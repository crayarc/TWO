<p>My Name is Mark Aguilar and I am a junior at the University of Houston majoring in Computer Information Systems. I received a formal education which has given me the experience I need to prepare for this class. After high school, I attended Lone Star College for two years and received an Associateâ€™s of Science Degree. I have job experience in retail and guest services. Through my working experience I have developed skills such as trying to help disgruntled customers, critical thinking, and dealing with multiple problems and people simultaneously. Dealing with a bulk of people on any given day has taught me to stay calm and analyze the situation at hand.
