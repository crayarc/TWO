<h1>About</h1>
<p>My Name is Mark Aguilar and I am a junior at the University of Houston and am majoring in Computer Information Systems.
	I received a formal education which has given me the experience I need to prepare for this class.
	I went to Cypress Ridge High School and received my diploma.
	After high school, I attended Lone Star College for two years and received an Associateâ€™s of Science Degree.
	I have job experience in retail and guest services.
	Through my working experience I have developed skills such as trying to help disgruntled customers, critical thinking, and dealing with multiple problems and people simultaneously.
	Dealing with a bulk of people on any given day has taught me to stay calm and analyze the situation at hand.
